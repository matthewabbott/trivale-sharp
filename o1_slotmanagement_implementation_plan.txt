Below is a **step‐by‐step architectural and implementation plan** that brings your current codebase closer to the design you described, with *clear separation of concerns* for Process Management, Slot Management, Resource Management, and UI Representation.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

### 1.1. Core Components

1. **ProcessManager** (Lifecycle + State):
   - Responsible for creating, loading, unloading, and tracking the lifecycle of processes.  
   - Maintains references to each active process object.  
   - Emits events when a process is created, changed, or destroyed.  
   - Delegates resource checks to the ResourceManager (or a consolidated MemoryManager if that remains your naming).  

2. **SlotManager** (Slots + Resource Allocation):
   - Owns the actual “slot” data structures (`IMemorySlot` or a new `Slot` type).  
   - Handles resource validation, slot states (empty, locked, loaded, etc.), dynamic unlocking.  
   - Constrains the maximum number of concurrently loaded processes (if you want).  
   - Exposes signals/events when a slot changes state (e.g., new process loaded, slot locked/unlocked).  

3. **ResourceManager** (Optional, if not already integrated in your existing `MemoryManager`):
   - Responsible for memory and CPU usage tracking, at the system-wide level.  
   - Provides methods to check if a process’s resource requirements can be fulfilled.  
   - Decrements or increments resource usage on process load/unload.  
   - Could be kept within `SlotManager` if you want to unify them (since your existing `MemoryManager` partially does this).  

4. **UI Components** (Menus, Slot Displays, Scenes, etc.):
   - Listens to signals from both the ProcessManager and SlotManager.  
   - Renders the updated state (which slots are locked/unlocked, which processes are loaded, resource usage, etc.).  
   - For each new advanced feature (drag-and-drop between slots, process previews), the UI triggers an action that calls into the managers’ *public methods or signals*, rather than implementing logic on its own.  

5. **Event/Signal Flow** (Event-Driven Architecture):
   - **SlotManager** signals:
     - `SlotStateChanged(slotId, newState)`
     - `SlotLocked(slotId)`
     - `SlotUnlocked(slotId)`
   - **ProcessManager** signals:
     - `ProcessStarted(processId, slotId)`
     - `ProcessUnloaded(processId, slotId)`
     - `ProcessStateChanged(processId, newState)`
   - The **UI** (e.g., `MemoryGridView`, `SlotGridDisplay`, or your main menu) connects to these signals to update visuals in real time.  

### 1.2. Lifecycle Overview

1. **UI requests** “load a process” into a slot:
   - UI calls **ProcessManager** → `LoadProcess(processType, maybeConfig, desiredSlotId?)`
   - **ProcessManager** checks with **SlotManager** + **ResourceManager** → “Is the slot available? Are resources sufficient?”
   - If yes, create process instance and store it. **SlotManager** marks the slot as ‘active’, sets state to `SlotStatus.Active`, etc.
   - Both managers emit signals → The UI listens → Displays the newly loaded process.

2. **Process runs** (the user or AI interacts with it):
   - The process updates itself or signals the manager with state changes (e.g., game round complete).
   - If the process is *scene-based*, the manager ensures the correct scene is loaded in the viewport.  

3. **UI or game logic** requests unloading or “closing” the process:
   - UI calls `ProcessManager.UnloadProcess(processId)` or the process signals it is complete.  
   - ProcessManager calls `SlotManager.FreeSlot(processId)`, cleans up references.  
   - Resource usage is freed, signals are emitted, the UI updates to show an empty or locked slot.

## 2. Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation

Below is a recommended incremental plan so you can keep your project running as you transition.

---

### 2.1. Introduce or Refine a `SlotManager`

#### 2.1.1. Create an `ISlotManager` Interface (Optional but Recommended)

```csharp
public interface ISlotManager
{
    event Action<string, SlotStatus> SlotStatusChanged;
    event Action<string> SlotUnlocked;
    event Action<string> SlotLocked;

    bool TryLoadProcessIntoSlot(IProcess process, out string slotId);
    void FreeSlot(string slotId);

    // Optionally for memory usage, or keep in ResourceManager:
    bool CanAllocateProcess(IProcess process);
    // ...
}
```

#### 2.1.2. Implement a Concrete `SlotManager` Class

If you already have a `MemoryManager` that partially does this, **either** rename it or combine. Here’s a minimal skeleton if you want a new one:

```csharp
public class SlotManager : Node, ISlotManager
{
    // List or dictionary of slots
    private Dictionary<string, IMemorySlot> _slots = new();
    
    public event Action<string, SlotStatus> SlotStatusChanged;
    public event Action<string> SlotUnlocked;
    public event Action<string> SlotLocked;

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Initialize your slots
        // For example, create 2 x 2 = 4 slots
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            var slotId = $"slot_{i}";
            _slots[slotId] = new MemorySlot(slotId, ...);
        }
    }

    public bool TryLoadProcessIntoSlot(IProcess process, out string slotId)
    {
        // Validate resources
        if (!CanAllocateProcess(process))
        {
            slotId = null;
            return false;
        }

        // Find a free or unlocked slot
        foreach (var kvp in _slots)
        {
            if (kvp.Value.Status == SlotStatus.Empty)
            {
                slotId = kvp.Key;
                LoadProcess(process, kvp.Value);
                return true;
            }
        }

        slotId = null;
        return false;
    }

    private void LoadProcess(IProcess process, IMemorySlot slot)
    {
        slot.LoadProcess(process);
        // Possibly update resource usage if you do that here
        // Emit signals
        SlotStatusChanged?.Invoke(slot.Id, slot.Status);
    }

    public void FreeSlot(string slotId)
    {
        if (!_slots.ContainsKey(slotId)) return;
        _slots[slotId].UnloadProcess();
        SlotStatusChanged?.Invoke(slotId, _slots[slotId].Status);
    }

    public bool CanAllocateProcess(IProcess process)
    {
        // If you do memory/CPU checks in a separate ResourceManager, 
        // call that here. Otherwise, check in the slot or manager directly.
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:  
- This manager deals purely with slot operations.  
- It emits signals when a slot changes.  
- It does *not* create processes itself; it only receives them from `ProcessManager`.

#### 2.1.3. Integrate Resource Management (If desired here)
If your existing `MemoryManager` class already has resource checks, you can merge it with the logic above or keep them separate:

```csharp
// In SlotManager
public float TotalMemory => 8.0f;
public float UsedMemory { get; private set; }
// etc.
```

---

### 2.2. Create or Refine a `ProcessManager`

#### 2.2.1. Define `IProcessManager`:

```csharp
public interface IProcessManager
{
    event Action<string, string> ProcessStarted; // (processId, slotId)
    event Action<string> ProcessEnded;           // processId
    event Action<string> ProcessStateChanged;    // processId or new state

    string CreateProcess(string processType, Dictionary<string, object> initParams = null);
    bool StartProcess(string processId, out string slotId);
    bool UnloadProcess(string processId);
    
    IProcess GetProcess(string processId);
}
```

#### 2.2.2. Implement a Concrete `ProcessManager` Class

```csharp
public class ProcessManager : Node, IProcessManager
{
    private Dictionary<string, IProcess> _processes = new();
    private ISlotManager _slotManager;

    public event Action<string, string> ProcessStarted;
    public event Action<string> ProcessEnded;
    public event Action<string> ProcessStateChanged;

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Possibly get a reference to your SlotManager from the scene tree
        // or pass it in a custom Initialize(...) method.
        _slotManager = GetNode<SlotManager>("../SlotManager"); 
        // Or pass via DI
    }

    public string CreateProcess(string processType, Dictionary<string, object> initParams = null)
    {
        var processId = $"proc_{Guid.NewGuid()}";
        IProcess newProcess = processType switch
        {
            "CardGame" => new CardGameMenuProcess(processId),
            "Debug" => new DebugMenuProcess(processId),
            _ => null
        };

        if (newProcess == null)
            return null;

        // Hook up state-changed events from the process
        newProcess.StateChanged += OnProcessStateChanged;
        _processes[processId] = newProcess;
        GD.Print($"Created process: {processId}");
        return processId;
    }

    public bool StartProcess(string processId, out string slotId)
    {
        slotId = null;
        if (!_processes.ContainsKey(processId)) return false;

        var process = _processes[processId];
        if (!_slotManager.TryLoadProcessIntoSlot(process, out slotId))
        {
            GD.PrintErr("Failed to load process into any slot.");
            return false;
        }
        
        process.Initialize(null); // or pass initParams you stored
        ProcessStarted?.Invoke(processId, slotId);
        return true;
    }

    public bool UnloadProcess(string processId)
    {
        if (!_processes.TryGetValue(processId, out var process))
            return false;

        // Find which slot it was in
        foreach (var kvp in /* _slotManager.Slots ??? somehow get the list */)
        {
            if (kvp.Value.CurrentProcess == process)
            {
                _slotManager.FreeSlot(kvp.Key);
                break;
            }
        }

        process.Cleanup();
        process.StateChanged -= OnProcessStateChanged;
        _processes.Remove(processId);
        ProcessEnded?.Invoke(processId);

        return true;
    }

    public IProcess GetProcess(string processId)
    {
        return _processes.TryGetValue(processId, out var proc) ? proc : null;
    }

    private void OnProcessStateChanged(Dictionary<string, object> newState)
    {
        // Possibly identify which process changed (some processId in newState?)
        // Then emit your event
        // ProcessStateChanged?.Invoke(processId);
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:  
- The `ProcessManager` is solely in charge of creating process objects and telling the `SlotManager` to load them.  
- It also listens to process signals (like `StateChanged`) so you can forward those events to the UI.  
- The `SlotManager` or `MemoryManager` is responsible for validating resources.  

---

### 2.3. UI Wiring & Dependency Injection

#### 2.3.1. Main Scene Setup

1. Create a single root node (for example, `MainRoot` or `GameRoot`) in your main scene.  
2. Add `SlotManager` and `ProcessManager` as child nodes.  
3. In `_Ready()`, ensure the manager references are passed around if you’re not using explicit node paths:

```csharp
public partial class MainRoot : Node
{
    private SlotManager _slotManager;
    private ProcessManager _processManager;
    private SimpleMainMenu _mainMenu; // if you want to pass references

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _slotManager = GetNode<SlotManager>("SlotManager");
        _processManager = GetNode<ProcessManager>("ProcessManager");
        _slotManager.Name = "SlotManager"; // ensure stable name
        _processManager.Name = "ProcessManager";

        // If your main menu is also a child of this node:
        _mainMenu = GetNode<SimpleMainMenu>("SimpleMainMenu");
        _mainMenu.Initialize(_processManager, _slotManager);
    }
}
```

#### 2.3.2. Initialize the UI with Managers

Inside `SimpleMainMenu` (or your new UI code), create an `Initialize()` method:

```csharp
public partial class SimpleMainMenu : Control
{
    private IProcessManager _processManager;
    private ISlotManager _slotManager;

    public void Initialize(IProcessManager processManager, ISlotManager slotManager)
    {
        _processManager = processManager;
        _slotManager = slotManager;

        // Subscribe to events
        _processManager.ProcessStarted += OnProcessStarted;
        _processManager.ProcessEnded += OnProcessEnded;
        _slotManager.SlotStatusChanged += OnSlotStatusChanged;
        
        // etc...
    }
    
    private void OnProcessStarted(string processId, string slotId)
    {
        GD.Print($"[UI] Process {processId} started in slot {slotId}");
        // Possibly update UI to reflect that slot is now loaded
    }

    private void OnSlotStatusChanged(string slotId, SlotStatus status)
    {
        GD.Print($"[UI] Slot {slotId} changed status to {status}");
        // Update UI visuals
    }

    // ...
}
```

#### 2.3.3. Handling UI Actions

When the user presses “Load Card Game,” the UI calls:
```csharp
private void OnCardGameButtonPressed()
{
    var processId = _processManager.CreateProcess("CardGame");
    if (processId == null)
    {
        GD.PrintErr("Failed to create CardGame process");
        return;
    }
    
    // Try starting it
    if (_processManager.StartProcess(processId, out var slotId))
    {
        GD.Print($"CardGame process started in slot {slotId}");
    }
    else
    {
        GD.PrintErr("Could not load process into any slot!");
    }
}
```

**This** (instead of “manually creating a CardGameMenuProcess and adding it to some `ProcessManager` or memory slot yourself) ensures the logic is centralized.

---

### 2.4. Updated UI for Multiple Slots

With the new managers in place, your `MemoryGridView` or `SlotGridDisplay` can simply:

1. Listen to `SlotManager.SlotStatusChanged`.  
2. Update each slot widget accordingly.  
3. If you want dynamic unlocking, your UI calls `_slotManager.UnlockSlot(slotIndex)` or something similar, and the slot manager emits `SlotUnlocked` → UI picks it up, updates visuals.

---

### 2.5. Process Scenes (Optional Variation)

If each process is also a scene that must load into a viewport, you can store in the process’s `Initialize()` a reference to a `PackedScene` or `ScenePath`, so that the `ProcessManager` can handle “instantiate scene → add to viewport.”  
- Alternatively, keep the code you have in `SimpleMainMenu` that calls `LoadSceneInViewport(...)` *after* the process is successfully started.  
- Make sure you have a `ProcessManager.GetProcessScene(processId)` or something similar, if you want the manager to supply a fully instanced scene.

---

### 2.6. Testing and Verification

1. **Unit Test** `SlotManager` for slot transitions:
   - `TryLoadProcessIntoSlot()` with sufficient resources → should succeed.  
   - `TryLoadProcessIntoSlot()` with insufficient resources → should fail.  
   - `FreeSlot(...)` → slot returns to empty, signals are fired.  

2. **Unit Test** `ProcessManager`:
   - `CreateProcess("CardGame")` → returns a valid process ID.  
   - `StartProcess(...)` → checks it loads into a slot or fails if no slot is free.  
   - `UnloadProcess(...)` → ensures it cleans up references and frees the slot.  

3. **Integration Test** the UI:
   - Press your “Card Game” button → verify logs or debug UI that the slot is loaded.  
   - Then “Return to Menu” → verify that the process is unloaded, slot is freed.  

4. **Documentation**:
   - Write quick docs for each manager (`ProcessManager`, `SlotManager`) and how the UI calls them.  
   - Keep a list of signals, their arguments, and typical usage.  

---

## 3. Further Extensions & Best Practices

1. **Drag & Drop**:  
   - The UI would handle the drag events, then call `ProcessManager.MoveProcess(processId, targetSlotId)` or something.  
   - `ProcessManager` would handle or delegate to `SlotManager` the resource checks.  

2. **Cross-Slot Communication**:  
   - Processes can request data from other processes or from the manager. If you do this a lot, consider a small “EventBus” or “Mediator” pattern for inter‐process events.  

3. **Scene Lifecycle**:
   - If you want each process to own a scene that must be loaded/unloaded, consider giving each process a `GetScene()` method returning an already-cached or newly instanced scene.  
   - The manager or the UI calls that method, places the scene in a viewport, and unsubscribes on unload.  

4. **Resource Manager**:
   - If your game design includes heavier resource constraints, a dedicated `IResourceManager` that the `ProcessManager` checks for resource availability (or the `SlotManager` calls it) can keep your code clean and future-proof.  

5. **Documentation**:
   - You might place a `README.md` in your `Managers/` folder describing how to use each manager, the signals, and the data flow.  

---

## 4. Summary of What to Implement Next

1. **Create** or **Refactor** `SlotManager`:
   - Possibly rename `MemoryManager` to `SlotManager` if that’s closer to your new concept.  
   - Implement an interface.  
   - Use signals for slot changes.  

2. **Refine** your existing `ProcessManager` or create a new one:
   - Make it the single authority for creating processes.  
   - Let it call `SlotManager.TryLoadProcessIntoSlot(...)`.  
   - Emit signals for UI updates.  

3. **Update** your main UI (`SimpleMainMenu` or whatever else):
   - Instead of manually messing with slot internals, call the manager’s public API.  
   - Listen to the manager’s signals to refresh UI state.  

4. **Re-wire** your `MemoryGridView` or `SlotGridDisplay` to listen to `SlotManager`:
   - On `_SlotStatusChanged`, visually update.  
   - On user click or drag, call `ProcessManager` or `SlotManager` methods.  

By completing these steps, you’ll have a robust, extensible foundation that clearly separates:

- **Business logic** (Process & Slot management)  
- **UI representation** (Your SimpleMainMenu, memory slot displays, etc.)  
- **Resource constraints** (Within `SlotManager` or a dedicated ResourceManager)  

That foundation will then make advanced features—like dynamic unlocking, cross-process resource sharing, or drag-and-drop transitions—much simpler to implement and maintain.

---

**Good luck with the refactoring!** This plan should give you enough structure to break the “monolithic references” pattern, eliminate order-of-operations issues, and ensure your advanced MEM slot and multi-process system remains scalable and clean.
