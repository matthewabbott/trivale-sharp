Below is a **step-by-step** outline to implement *Additional MEM Slot Display* with a future-proof approach that can later accommodate **hierarchical** relationships, **tree-like** visuals, and **expanded resources**. The plan balances **short-term** needs (showing newly unlocked slots) with the **long-term** architecture (hierarchical or process-driven slot structure).

---

## 1. High-Level Goals

1. **Show Additional Slots** when the first process (or any process) loads, reflecting the unlocking logic.  
2. **Visualize Slots in a Tree-Like Format** (e.g. ASCII sub-branches).  
3. **Be Ready** for future expansions (child slots, advanced process relationships).

---

## 2. Core Components & Responsibilities

1. **`ISlotManager` / `SlotManager`**  
   - Maintains the actual slot data (locked/unlocked, status, process loaded).  
   - Handles resource constraints and unlocking logic.

2. **`SlotGridSystem`**  
   - Maintains an **internal snapshot** (dictionary) of `(slotId -> SlotState)` for the UI.  
   - Receives events from `SlotManager` (e.g. `SlotUnlocked`, `SlotStatusChanged`) and updates local `SlotState` objects.  
   - Exposes signals like `SlotStateChanged` for the display to respond.

3. **`SlotGridDisplay`**  
   - Renders ASCII or textual representation of the slots.  
   - Subscribes to `SlotStateChanged`.  
   - Decides how to visually format the slots (tree-like).

4. **`IProcessManager` / `ProcessManager`**  
   - Creates processes, loads them into the first available slot, triggers slot unlocks.  
   - Might also implement custom logic: e.g. *“Unlock 3 slots the first time a process is started.”*

---

## 3. Detailed Steps

### 3.1. Extend ProcessManager to Unlock Additional Slots

**Goal**: When the first process loads, unlock some number of slots automatically.  
- *Minimal path*: In `ProcessManager.StartProcess(...)` (or wherever you already have a comment like “When a process starts, unlock the next two slots”), continue or refine that logic.

**Implementation Outline**:
1. **Track** whether we have already unlocked “additional” slots.  
   - A simple boolean `_extraSlotsUnlocked` or a counter `_slotsUnlockedCount`.
2. **When the first process loads** (or each time a new process starts)  
   - If `_extraSlotsUnlocked` is `false`, call `_slotManager.UnlockSlot(...)` on some additional slots.  
   - Mark `_extraSlotsUnlocked = true` (or increment counters, etc.).  
   - This triggers the `SlotUnlocked` event, which `SlotGridSystem` listens for.

```csharp
private bool _extraSlotsUnlocked = false;

public bool StartProcess(string processId, out string slotId)
{
    ...
    if (!_extraSlotsUnlocked)
    {
        UnlockAdditionalSlots(2);
        _extraSlotsUnlocked = true;
    }
    ...
}
```

This ensures the slot manager (and, in turn, the UI) reacts properly.

### 3.2. Adjust SlotGridSystem for Potential Hierarchies

Currently, `SlotGridSystem` mostly tracks a **grid**. To move toward a **tree** in the future:

1. **Add** a concept of *“parent slot”* or *“parent process”* if you eventually want slot child–parent relationships.  
   - For now, keep it simple: all newly unlocked slots are just “siblings.”
2. **Add** a helper method to determine display ordering, e.g. `GetDisplayOrder()`, which returns a list of `(slotId, SlotState)` in the order you want them drawn.  
   - Initially, it might be simple: sort by locked vs unlocked, with the *active slot* first.  
   - Or continue sorting by `GridPosition`—just ensure you can swap in a new ordering later.

**Example**:

```csharp
private IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, SlotState>> GetDisplayOrder()
{
    // Option 1: If you still want grid-based order:
    return _slots
        .OrderBy(kvp => kvp.Value.GridPosition.Y)
        .ThenBy(kvp => kvp.Value.GridPosition.X);

    // Option 2: A custom approach that places the first active slot at top:
    // 1) find active slot (if any),
    // 2) put it first,
    // 3) then list the rest
}
```

This abstraction is key—**you can later do** a more elaborate tree or process-based ordering **without** changing the rest of `SlotGridDisplay`.

---

### 3.3. Modify `SlotGridDisplay` to Render the “Tree” ASCII

In your current code, you do something like:

```csharp
var slots = _slotSystem.GetAllSlots()
    .OrderBy(...) // sort
    .ToList();
var firstActiveSlot = slots.FirstOrDefault(s => s.Value.IsActive);
bool hasActiveSlot = firstActiveSlot.Key != null;

foreach (var (slotId, slot) in slots) {
    ...
}
```

But you ran into an error with `slots.IndexOf((slotId, slot))` because `slots` is a list of `KeyValuePair<string, SlotState>`, whereas `(slotId, slot)` is a raw tuple.

**Fix**:  
1. Create a helper function to find the index:  
   ```csharp
   private int GetIndex(List<KeyValuePair<string, SlotState>> slotList, string slotId)
   {
       return slotList.FindIndex(kvp => kvp.Key == slotId);
   }
   ```
2. Then do:  
   ```csharp
   int index = GetIndex(slots, slotId);
   bool isLast = (index == slots.Count - 1);
   ```

**Add “tree lines”:**  
1. If you want the *active slot* to appear as the “root” (`└── ■`) and everything else as branches:  
   - If `slotId == firstActiveSlot.Key`:  
     ```csharp
     display.AppendLine($"└── {slotSymbol} [{slot.LoadedText.PadRight(10)}]");
     ```
   - Else, indent:  
     ```csharp
     bool isLast = index == slots.Count - 1;
     display.AppendLine($"    {(isLast ? "└" : "├")}── {slotSymbol} [{slot.LoadedText.PadRight(10)}]");
     ```
2. For a deeper tree, you’d recursively build child lines—but for now, you can do a 2-level display.

---

### 3.4. Test with Different Unlocking Behaviors

To confirm it works:
1. **Start** the game in `SimpleMainMenu` or `DebugScene`.  
2. **Load** the first process (e.g. “Debug Process”).  
3. **Verify** that `ProcessManager` calls `UnlockAdditionalSlots(2)`.  
4. **Observe** `SlotGridSystem` receiving `SlotUnlocked`.  
5. **Check** `SlotGridDisplay` now draws 2 extra unlocked slots in a second-level tree line.  
   - `└── ■ [Debug   ]`  
   - `    ├── □ [        ]`  
   - `    └── □ [        ]`

---

## 4. Future Enhancements / Next Steps

1. **Process-Driven Hierarchy**  
   - Eventually, if you want child slots to appear as sub-branches of the process that spawned them, store a `ParentSlotId` or `ParentProcessId` in each slot’s data. Then you can recursively build a tree in `SlotGridDisplay`.

2. **Adaptive Resizing**  
   - As you expand the ASCII tree, ensure the container can handle dynamic text size.  
   - For more advanced UI, you might let tree lines wrap or use scrollbars.

3. **Resource Visualization**  
   - Next step is showing CPU/MEM usage next to each slot.  
   - This can be done in the ASCII lines, e.g. `[MEM: 0.3, CPU: 0.2]`.

4. **Drag-and-Drop** or more advanced UI  
   - For full “desktop-like” interactions, you might eventually replace ASCII with a dynamic Godot layout (e.g. tree nodes, clickable expansions, real-time resource bars).

---

## 5. Summary of Changes

### **(A) `ProcessManager`:**  
- Add or refine logic in `StartProcess(processId, out slotId)` to unlock extra slots upon the first (or every) load.  

### **(B) `SlotGridSystem`:**  
- Possibly add a `GetDisplayOrder()` method to keep sorting logic separate.  
- When `SlotUnlocked` or `SlotStatusChanged` occurs, update `_slots[slotId]` accordingly.  
- Emit your own `SlotStateChanged`.

### **(C) `SlotGridDisplay`:**  
- Subscribe to `SlotStateChanged`.  
- Build a list from `GetDisplayOrder()`.  
- Use a helper function to find the index:  
  ```csharp
  int index = GetIndex(slotList, slotId);
  bool isLast = (index == slotList.Count - 1);
  ```
- Render ASCII lines accordingly.

### **(D) Testing**  
- Use `DebugScene` or your main menu test environment to confirm:  
  - Process loads → triggers slot unlock → display updates.  
  - The ASCII lines appear in the correct order.  
  - Additional slots show up as branches under the active slot.

---

## 6. Implementation Tips

- **Keep it Simple First**: Implement the minimal “root + siblings” approach. If you only do two levels, that’s fine for now.  
- **Hide Additional Complexity**: Put sorting/ordering logic behind a helper or extension method so you can pivot to *true* hierarchy later.  
- **Document** as you go. Note in your code or docstrings where you’ll add recursion or deeper hierarchy if needed.  
- **Iterate**: Once basic “unlock 2 slots → show them as sub-branches” is confirmed, you can refine the visuals or expand the logic to multiple processes, deeper nesting, etc.

## 7. Conclusion

This plan gives you a **straight path** to:

1. Display newly unlocked MEM slots in a “tree-like” ASCII format.  
2. Keep your **process logic** cleanly separated from **UI logic**, while building the **foundation** for more advanced hierarchical or process-based relationships later.

**Implementation Roadmap**:

1. **Update `ProcessManager`** to consistently unlock N slots upon first process load.  
2. **Enhance `SlotGridSystem`** to track new slots, define a consistent display order, and emit signals.  
3. **Fix `SlotGridDisplay`** to avoid tuple index errors, using a custom index finder or a carefully typed approach.  
4. **Verify** in your debug/test scenes.  
5. **Iterate** to refine the ASCII structure, unlocking logic, or resource visuals.
