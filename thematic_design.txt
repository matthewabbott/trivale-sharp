# Trick Taker: Visual and Thematic Design Document

## Core Theme
A cyberpunk terminal-based card game where hacking is represented through trick-taking mechanics. Players, as netrunners, perceive cyberspace through a unique lens where security systems and hacking tools manifest as cards and card games. This perception filter provides an intuitive interface to complex system interactions.
