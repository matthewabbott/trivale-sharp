Below is a **practical cleanup plan** for your codebase, focusing on preventing the “accessing a disposed object” errors while also keeping in mind your eventual design goals (multiple concurrently loaded scenes, easy switching in a viewport, minimal coupling, and robust process management). We’ll walk through the main “poor practices” in your existing approach and recommend alternatives that fit your intended future design.

## 1. Identify Problematic Patterns

Let’s look at the major areas in your code that can lead to “disposed object” scenarios when re‐launching scenes or storing references to soon‐to‐be-freed nodes.

1. **Scene Tree Searches**  
   - You have methods like:
     ```csharp
     private UI.Components.SlotGridSystem FindSlotGridSystem()
     {
         // tries to find a slot grid system by recursively scanning the tree
     }
     ```
   - **Issue**: If your manager or process tries to do a “find” on the scene tree (especially after that scene has been unloaded), it may iterate over Freed nodes.  
   - **Symptom**: “Cannot access a disposed object (Godot.Button)” if your find or walk hits a node that was `QueueFree()`’d but not fully gone from memory or if the manager is referencing an old scene branch that no longer exists.

2. **Residual Signal Connections**  
   - Scenes or nodes that connected signals to your managers (or vice versa) but never disconnected.  
   - **Issue**: When the node is Freed, you can’t call methods on it. If the manager still tries to do so (via signal or direct call), you get “disposed object” errors.

3. **Dangling References in Managers**  
   - Code that caches references to old scene nodes in dictionaries, static fields, or manager variables.  
   - **Issue**: Once the scene is Freed, those references are invalid.  
   - **Symptom**: “Object Freed” errors on second load, because the manager tries to do something with a node that’s gone.

4. **Implicit Coupling in the Process & Slot Manager**  
   - `ProcessManager` or `SlotManager` referencing the entire scene or sub‐trees.  
   - **Issue**: This design is fragile: if your manager is part of (or outside of) the scene tree, it must carefully handle references.  
   - **Symptom**: After you unload a scene, manager code still tries to talk to Freed UI nodes.

5. **One‐Off Patches Instead of Central Lifecycle**  
   - You have partial cleanup in `OnSceneUnloadRequest` but might not fully unhook signals or references.

## 2. Recommendations & Corrective Steps

Below is a set of recommended steps for each problem area. I’ve also included suggestions aligned to your **future plan** of having multiple scenes loaded (with only one actively displayed in a viewport) but readily switchable.

### 2.1. Avoid Blind Tree Searches in Managers

**Problem**: Searching the entire tree or connecting to Freed nodes.

**Better Practice**:  
- **Inject** references from a top-level “scene orchestrator” or from the main menu script.  
- The manager never does a “recursive find” of UI. Instead, the main menu or your top-level node passes the relevant UI reference (like a `SlotGridSystem`) into the manager’s constructor or an `Initialize(uiReference)` method.
  
**Example**:
```csharp
// In SimpleMainMenu or a top-level script:
private SlotGridSystem _slotGridSystem;

public override void _Ready()
{
    // We manually get a reference to our UI node
    _slotGridSystem = GetNode<SlotGridSystem>("Path/To/SlotGridSystem");

    // Then pass it to the manager
    _processManager = new ProcessManager(_slotManager, _slotGridSystem);
}

// In ProcessManager:
public ProcessManager(ISlotManager slotManager, SlotGridSystem slotGrid)
{
    _slotManager = slotManager;
    _slotGridSystem = slotGrid;
    // No more 'FindSlotGridSystem' logic
}
```
By injecting references rather than searching, you **never** accidentally walk Freed parts of the tree.

### 2.2. Strictly Disconnect Signals on Scene Unload

**Problem**: Freed nodes remain connected to signals or the manager tries to call Freed nodes.

**Better Practice**:  
1. **Use `_ExitTree`** or a special “Cleanup” method to systematically disconnect signals.  
2. For example, in your `DebugScene`:
   ```csharp
   public override void _ExitTree()
   {
       // Disconnect all signals from the manager or system
       // manager.SomeSignal -= SomeMethod; // if using C# event
       base._ExitTree();
   }
   ```
3. If your manager connected to the scene’s signals, the manager should do:
   ```csharp
   _debugScene.SomeSignal -= OnDebugSceneSignal;
   ```
   right before the scene is Freed or in the scene’s unload method.

### 2.3. Clean Up Dangling References to Freed Scenes

**Problem**: Manager or other code storing references to an old scene’s nodes.

**Better Practice**:
1. **Keep the Manager’s references to scene objects ephemeral**. Once the scene is Freed or “unloaded,” the manager sets those references to `null`.  
2. If you need to keep a “representative” object for a background or hidden scene, store it in a dictionary that is cleared when unloading.  
3. Implement a robust “on unload” that forcibly `null`s out those references:
   ```csharp
   private Node _debugSceneInstance;  // stored at manager or orchestrator level

   public void UnloadDebugScene()
   {
       if (_debugSceneInstance != null)
       {
           _debugSceneInstance.QueueFree();
           _debugSceneInstance = null; // remove reference
       }
   }
   ```
   This ensures the manager can’t call methods on Freed nodes.

### 2.4. Rework the ProcessManager to *Not* Depend on Scene UI

**Problem**: Tying your process/slot logic to searching or updating scene UI leads to Freed object references.

**Better Practice**:  
- The manager (pure logic & memory) shouldn’t do any direct scene modifications. Instead, it emits events (“slot loaded,” “slot freed,” “process started,” “process ended”) or sets some abstract data.  
- Another system (like `SimpleMainMenu` or a “UI Orchestrator”) listens to those events and updates the UI.  
- This is **Inversion of Control**: the manager knows nothing about how the UI is displayed. The UI is a subscriber to manager events.

### 2.5. Keep Scenes in Memory But “Hidden” Instead of Freed, If That’s Your Future Plan

You mentioned **multiple scenes loaded** with one “active” scene in the viewport, others off-screen. This means you’ll likely do:

1. **Instantiate** multiple scene instances at once.  
2. Have an “active scene” pointer that’s put into the main Viewport container.  
3. For the others, keep them as children of some “Hidden Scenes” node or just disable them (or keep them in a dictionary).

**Implementation**:
- Suppose you have a `SceneOrchestrator` node that keeps a dictionary:  
  ```csharp
  private Dictionary<string, Node> _loadedScenes = new();

  public void LoadScene(string sceneName)
  {
      if (_loadedScenes.ContainsKey(sceneName))
      {
          // Already loaded
          return;
      }
      var scene = ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>(sceneName).Instantiate();
      // Make it invisible or no parent
      AddChild(scene);
      scene.Visible = false;
      _loadedScenes[sceneName] = scene;
  }

  public void ShowScene(string sceneName)
  {
      if (!_loadedScenes.TryGetValue(sceneName, out var scene))
          return;
      HideAllLoadedScenes();
      scene.Visible = true;
  }
  ```
- Then you only `QueueFree()` a scene if you want to remove it entirely from memory. This approach ensures no more “disposed node” references, because you never Freed it—just hid it.  

**Important**: The manager never does “hide or show” calls. It only triggers an event “Encounter X loaded.” The top-level orchestrator decides “Ok, I’ll show it in the viewport or hide it.”

## 3. Concrete Cleanups & Next Steps

### 3.1. Remove or Refactor “FindSlotGridSystem” & Similar Methods

- **Delete** the “find” logic in `ProcessManager.CacheSlotGridSystem()` and `FindSlotGridSystem()`.  
- Instead, pass an explicit reference once:  
  ```csharp
  _processManager.SetSlotGridSystem(_slotGridSystem);
  ```
- In `SlotGridSystem`, do the same: it should never “find” the manager. The orchestrator or your main menu sets them up.

### 3.2. Phase Out the “One‐Off” Scene Unload Logic That Unloads Processes Internally

- Right now, your `DebugScene` calls “Unload Process” or “SceneUnloadRequested,” which leads to the manager trying to do final cleanup.  
- **Better**: centralize the “Close Scene” logic in the top‐level orchestrator or the main menu. Let the scene just emit “I want to close,” but do the real unload from a single known place. That single place:  
  1. Disconnect signals.  
  2. Freed or hidden scene.  
  3. Notifies the manager that this process is done.  

### 3.3. Disconnect or Nullify on `_ExitTree()`

- In each scene script (like `DebugScene.cs`), override `_ExitTree()` and systematically ensure it is no longer referencing the manager or hooking signals.  
- Similarly, if the manager had references to that scene, it sets them to `null`.

### 3.4. Implement a “Multi‐Scene” Orchestrator

- A single C# script, e.g. `SceneOrchestrator.cs`, that:  
  - Holds references/dictionaries for all “loaded” scenes.  
  - Decides which scene is shown in the main viewport.  
  - Unloads/frees scenes at the appropriate time.  
  - Maintains the “active scene” concept so it can be easily swapped.  
- The manager only deals with your memory slot system, not with the actual Godot scene objects. Instead, it publishes events like “PROCESS_STARTED” or “PROCESS_ENDED.” Your Orchestrator uses that to update the loaded scenes as needed.

### 3.5. Adjust to Support “Multiple Concurrent Scenes” Cleanly

- If your manager can run multiple processes (some in background), store each process in a dictionary keyed by process ID.  
- If those processes are associated with scene Node instances, store them in the Orchestrator.  
- “Active process” is the one you place in the main viewport. Others remain in memory, presumably with `.Visible = false`.  
- This approach ensures you never free the node until you truly want to. No Freed references → no “Cannot access disposed object.”

## 4. Summary of Your Cleanup Plan

1. **Eliminate Blind Tree Walks**: Replace “find or find recursive” calls with direct references.  
2. **Disconnect Signals**: Both ways. Scenes → manager or manager → scene must disconnect on `_ExitTree()` or on “Unload.”  
3. **Nullify Freed References**: The manager must not keep references to Freed nodes.  
4. **Separate Logic from UI**: The manager should not handle or track UI nodes. It should only track process states and raise events. The UI or “Orchestrator” implements the actual scene changes.  
5. **Introduce an Orchestrator**: A top‐level node (like `SimpleMainMenu` or a dedicated `SceneOrchestrator`) that:  
   - Loads/unloads scenes.  
   - Maintains a dictionary of “loaded scene = node reference.”  
   - Displays one or more in the main viewport.  
   - Cleans up references on unload.  
6. **Support Multi‐Scene**: By never calling `QueueFree()` until you want them truly gone, you can keep multiple scenes in memory, toggling which one is in the viewport.  

Following these steps should fix the immediate “disposed object” problem and simultaneously set you up for your future design (multiple loaded scenes that can be switched in and out).
